Huge thanks to the creator [thiagorossener](https://github.com/thiagorossener)  
See the [demo here](https://jekflix.rossener.com/). 

Changed a lot of files, opted for a more minimalistic look.  
Grabbed a copyright-free Cyberpunk photo to use as a the main background photo.  
Also added Spotify button and included a new scss class "post-content-two", to try to minimize less white-space on the sides.  
If you use the template too and have trouble editing or customizing things, feel free to reach out!
