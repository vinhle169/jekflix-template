# <em><strong>ヾ(＾∇＾) About Me<em><strong>  
<i>If you want to learn more about my technical experience, then check out my [CV](/cv).</i>  
<br>
&ensp; My name is Vinh and I am a recent grad from MIT. I majored in [Computation and Cognition](https://bcs.mit.edu/academic-program/course-6-9-computation-and-cognition), 
class of 2022(B.S.) & 2023(MEng). I am passionate about learning, both in concept and action. To pursue this passion, 
I engaged in advanced research projects that explored the intersection of computing and neuroscience, gaining valuable 
experience in software engineering and data science.
I utilized my expertise in computer science and cognitive science to delve into topics such as 
deep learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. 
<br>
&ensp; Currently, I am seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting. I am open to any 
software engineer/data science/machine learning adjacent positions and I am
eager to explore new frontiers and contribute to cutting-edge projects. 
I am committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of emerging technologies in order to deliver in any environment.
